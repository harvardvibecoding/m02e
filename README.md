Continuing on from the prior unit, this project contains the resulting output of the instructor's AI when prompted for Harvard-style branding with readable columns in `people_headcount_app.py`. The learner can optionally begin prompting from here to fix sidebar readability.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run people_headcount_app.py
```
